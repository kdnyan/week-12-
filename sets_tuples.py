# sets and tuples examples 
# sets examples:
set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
print(set1) # (1,2,3,4,5)
print(type(set1)) # <class 'set'>
set1.add(6)
print(set1) # (1,2,3,4,5,6)
set1.remove(2)
print(set1) #(1,2,3,4,5,6)

#sets drop duplicate items:
set2 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "cherry")
print (set2) # apple banana cherry

#tuples examples
tuple1= (1,2,3,4,5)
print(tuple1) # 1,2,3,4,5
print(type(tuple1)) #<class 'tuple"
#tuples are immulatble, meaning they cannot be changed after creation
# this makes tuples useful for storing data that should not be modified
